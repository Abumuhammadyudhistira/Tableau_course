1. Tableau Basics
	# Connecting Tableau to Data File - Text File, CSV
	# Navigating Tableau
	# creating calculated fields TotalSales = Units*Units Price
	# Adding colors drag and press control
	# Labels and Formatting
	# exporting data


2. Time Series Aggregation and Filters
	# Working with data extracts
	connect to excel
	data extracts

	# working with time series 
	aggregation and granularity
	can be as measures (numerical) or dimensions (categorical)

	# understanding aggregation, granularity, and level of detail
	filter and quick filter
	line chart, shapes, show-me, area chart, highlighting


3. Maps, Scatterplot, & Dashboard
	# Joining Data in Tableau
	# Create Map, working with hierarchies (geography)
	# create scatterplot applying filters to multiple worksheet
	# create dashboard
	# adding an interactive action - QuickFilter, Filter action
	# adding an interactive action - highlighting action
	map, scatterplot, dashboard layout

4. Joining on Multiple Fields
	# LEFT, RIGHT, INNER, and OUTER JOIN
	# join with duplicate values
	# joining with multiple fields (multiple match column):
	
	Table A				Table B
	Store	Order#	Customer	Store	Order#	Item	Sales
	North	001	Mike		North	001	Laptop	999
	North	002	Jack		North	001	Mouse	49
	South	001	Susan		North	002	Monitor	155
					South	001	Camera	97
	
	Left join
	on A.OrderNum = B.OrderNum
	AND A.Store = B.Store

	Table A				Table B
	Store	Order#	Customer	Store	Order#	Item	Sales
	North	001	Mike		North	001	Laptop	999
	North	001	Mike		North	001	Mouse	49
	North	002	Jack		North	002	Monitor	155
	South	001	Susan		South	001	Camera	97
	
	# Joining data vs blending data
	if the dataset is different (csv,excel,sql) you cannot do join
	it should be blending
	if you have different level of granularity you cannot do join
	it should be blending
	
	# Data blending - Left join
	left table the blue one
	orange table the orange one
	if you see it automatically an orang chain appear beside column
	it because the same column name
	can be controlled through 'Data' menu
	occurs on the level of granularity of our view
	aggregations happens before the blend	

	# Dual Axis and Synchronize axis(y-axis matching)
	# creating calculated fields in a blend
	every data element used have to be aggregated (SUM, AVG, etc)
	

5. Table Calculations, Advanced Dashboards, Storytelling
	# downloading dataset and connecting to Tableau
	# Mapping geographical roles (globe symbol)
	right click on dimension - set geographic state/province
	# Table calculatoins for gender
	right click on measures features - quick table calculation (Percent of Total)
	# create bins and distributions for age
	right click on Data - Create Parameter
	# parameter for age(bin) / balance(bin)
	# tree map chart
	box form
	# customer segmentation dashboard
	for deeper understnading of data
	# advanced dashboard interactivity - no pop up(worksheet)
	# analyzing the customer segmentation dashboard
	the data has been shown will help you predict what kind of champaign
	you should use to approach certain market in different region
	# creating a storyline
	cannot combine 2 or more worksheet/dashboard
	change on one page in storyline won't influence another stroyline page
	filled map, pie chart, distributions, treemap, storyline

6. Advanced Data Preparation
	# what format your data should be in
	you will always find that your data is not properly cleaned
	especially for excel data where it is easily edited
	machine cannot easily understand data, not like human visual
	# Data interpreter	
	automatically clean your messy data
	# Pivot
	you will might need year column to be row
	block every column and right click pivot
	# spliting column into multiple column
	for example you have full name => first_name + last_name
	click on the right pane of column - split
	# metadata grid
	representation of your data - you can change column name etc
	# fixing geographical data errors
	example you have country data which is not exist in the map


7. Clusters, Custom Territories, Design Features
	# custom territories via groups
	click on every area on your map
	right click then choose create group
	
	# custom territories via Geographic Roles
	select dimension variable and right click

	# highlighting (almost similar with filter)
	when creating maps you should aware of some cities name which is not
	recognized by tableau, it would be easy if you input it through state
	differentiate data through highlight (rather than color or shape)
	
	# clustering using tableau
	create a scatter plot for y=revenue and x=marketing spend for each store id
	you will see a group of store id having a higher revenue when MS spend increase
	but you will see a group of store id not so good in revenue even if MS increase
	create clustering using - Analytics
	
	# Cross Database Join
	from clustered data we may assume that such a case happen because
	of the number of population in certain city
	it's gonna make sense when the higher number of population
	the higher number of dirty clothes
	so we need another data showing population
	now we can join data even from different source
	
	# Modeling with cluster
	when we input population as a parameter for clustering
	we see that population count more on deciding revenue

	you can make a trend line from clustered group of data
	by using analytics - it is a part of regression modelling

	we can filter trend line using highlighting for new store
	from a trend line we have we can see which one is the most 
	outstanding store to invest for money to acquire much profit (orange ones)
	
	# Save cluster
	after we create a cluster we can use it as a dimension so we should
	not plot it more and more for another worksheet we need

	# new design features
	www.tableau.com for tableau 10
	
	# new mobile features
	
	
8. What's new in Tableau
	# connecting into pdf
	merge mismatched component

	the data you acquire from pdf might have 'TOTAL' blabla
	you can remove/exclude it in data source by Filter 

	# connecting to spatial file
	Shapefiles
	MapInfo tables
	KML (Keyhole Markup Language)
	GEOJson
	
	# joining to spatial files
	join two name of park
	delete some file in pdf which doesn't exist on spatial

	# Putting it All together
	
	# Step and Jump Line Chart

	# Viz in tool tip
